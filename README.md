# Booking-Railway-Ticket-Code
Its a beginner code on booking of a ticket using Python


Here we have used the concepts the OOPS to perform our code using Python.
The code starts with defining the class train and then using Name variable to define the name of the train!
We have then use the self defined __init__ constructor to specify the what else we need as a objects in our class like status ,fare ,seats and food>>
So then we have defined every object of class Train!!
At last adding a cancelling ticket option to cancel the ticket we user wants to..
Then checking our code at last if it operate well..
